We know a good book when we read one, but do the masses? What factors contribute to a book's popularity? My data is from Kaggle, a data science resource, consisting of books from the BC era until 2016 and their publishing details. I seek to understand what extraneous elements within the publishing sphere relate to book popularity. By modeling [clear this up once I clear up the model] the publishing year, an integer variable, more recent books had a higher chance of being in-demand. Author popularity contributes about 30% more [fix statistic when I fix the model] than genre to book sales.
