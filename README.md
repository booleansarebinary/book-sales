We have our own ideas of what makes a book good or bad: sometimes we'll find ourselves in the majority, sometimes in the minority. What factors contribute to a book's popularity? My data is from Kaggle, a data science resource, consisting of books from the BC era until 2016 and their publishing details. I seek to understand what elements within the publishing sphere relate to book popularity. By modeling the genre (fiction or nonfiction) as a linear function, I found that fiction books tend to be more more popular. The 95% confidence interval for fiction books had an upper limit of 3249, whereas nonfiction books had an upper limit of 3082.
